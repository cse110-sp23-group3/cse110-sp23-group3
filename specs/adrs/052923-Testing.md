# ADR: Adopt Jest for Testing

## Context
As our codebase grows, it's essential to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. To accomplish this, we need a robust testing framework that supports our development workflow. Among the various testing frameworks available, Jest and Mocha are widely recognized in the JavaScript community.

## Decision
We will use Jest as the testing framework for our JavaScript codebase.

## Reason
The following reasons lead us to choose Jest:

1. **Zero-configuration:** Jest requires little to no configuration to get started, allowing us to focus on writing tests rather than setting up the testing environment.

2. **Built-in mocking and assertion library:** Jest comes with a powerful mocking library and assertion library, making it easier to write comprehensive tests.

3. **Performance:** Jest runs tests in parallel, which maximizes performance and makes testing faster.

4. **Snapshot testing:** Jest's snapshot testing feature ensures UI does not change unexpectedly, a valuable feature for front-end testing.

5. **Code coverage:** Jest has built-in support for tracking code coverage, providing valuable insights into how much of our code is covered by tests.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- Developers will need to familiarize themselves with Jest's syntax and conventions.
- Existing tests, if any, may need to be rewritten or migrated to Jest.
- The setup and configuration of the Jest environment will be required.
- Overall, Jest will help ensure the quality of our codebase and prevent regressions.
