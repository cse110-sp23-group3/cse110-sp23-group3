# ADR: Adopt JSDoc for Code Documentation

## Context
We need a consistent way to document our JavaScript codebase. Clear, consistent, and accessible documentation is essential for understanding the codebase, maintaining code quality, and onboarding new developers. While there are several documentation standards available, JSDoc and YUIDoc are the most popular.

## Decision

We will use JSDoc for documenting our JavaScript codebase.

## Reason

The following reasons lead us to choose JSDoc:

1. **Readability:** JSDoc uses a clear and easy-to-understand syntax for documenting code, improving readability for developers.

2. **Tooling and integration:** JSDoc offers a range of tooling options for generating documentation websites. It also integrates well with many code editors, providing real-time hints and autocompletion.

3. **Community support:** JSDoc has wide acceptance in the JavaScript community and a proven track record.

4. **Flexibility:** JSDoc allows us to document all parts of our code (modules, functions, parameters, classes, etc.), and it includes support for custom tags.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

- Our developers will need to learn the JSDoc syntax and conventions.
- We need to set up tools for generating and hosting JSDoc documentation.
- Using JSDoc will help new developers understand the codebase more quickly and help all developers write more maintainable code.
- A commitment to thorough JSDoc documentation will require additional development time.
