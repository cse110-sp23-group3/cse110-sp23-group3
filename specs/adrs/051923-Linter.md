# ADR: Use StandardJS as our JavaScript Linter

## Context
We need to choose a linter to ensure code consistency and quality in our JavaScript codebase. There are several popular choices available, including ESLint, JSLint, and StandardJS.

## Decision

We will use StandardJS as our JavaScript linter.

## Reason

The following reasons lead us to choose StandardJS:

1. **No configuration:** StandardJS comes with a predefined set of rules which saves us from the initial setup and constant configuration tweaking.

2. **Automatic formatting:** StandardJS not only detects issues in the code but also fixes them automatically where possible.

3. **Community acceptance:** StandardJS has wide acceptance in the community and is used by several large organizations, giving it a track record of reliability.

4. **Integrated environment support:** It supports usage in popular editors like VSCode, Atom, and Sublime Text which can show linting errors in real-time.

## Status

Accepted

## Consequences

- Our team will need to familiarize themselves with the StandardJS style guide and rules.
- We will need to set up our development environment to work with StandardJS, including possible editor plugins.
- Some developers may disagree with certain rules in StandardJS, as it is opinionated and does not allow custom configuration.
- The automatic formatting can help speed up development time and prevent trivial mistakes or style disagreements during code reviews.
