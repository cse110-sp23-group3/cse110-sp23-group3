# ADR: Define "Done" Criteria for Issues

## Context
As our team expands and takes on more complex tasks, we need to establish a shared understanding of what it means for an issue to be considered "done". This standardization will help in managing expectations, streamlining our workflow, and improving the quality of our output. 

## Decision
"Done" for an issue will be defined by the following criteria:

1. The task described in the issue has been completed.
2. Code associated with the issue has been thoroughly tested and passes all tests.
3. The code has been reviewed by at least one other team member and has been approved.
4. Any documentation or comments necessary for understanding the solution have been added.
5. The changes have been merged into the main branch and all associated CI/CD pipelines have passed.
6. The issue has been closed, and any related issues or tasks have been updated or created.

## Reason
Adopting these "done" criteria will provide numerous benefits:

1. **Clarity and Consistency:** Everyone on the team will have the same understanding of when a task is finished, reducing confusion and miscommunication.
2. **Quality Assurance:** Incorporating code review and testing into our "done" criteria helps to ensure the quality of our code.
3. **Documentation:** By requiring relevant documentation and comments, we can maintain a well-documented and understandable codebase.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences

- Team members will need to adjust their workflow to include the new "done" criteria.
- There may be an initial slowdown in issue completion as we adapt to the new process.
- The overall quality and maintainability of our codebase should improve.
- We will be able to more accurately track and forecast our progress in future sprints.
