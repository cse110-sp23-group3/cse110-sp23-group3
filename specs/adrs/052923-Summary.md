# ADR: Palm Reading Application Development

## Context
We are aiming to develop an application that offers palm reading services, capitalizing on the cultural fascination and curiosity surrounding palm reading, an ancient practice of fortune telling based on palm features.

## Decision
We are going to develop an interactive palm reading application that offers fortune telling services. This application will analyze various features on a user's palm, such as lines, hand shape, length, and mouth, to make predictions about the user's life, near future, and lucky number.

The application will be interactive, enabling users to answer questions based on displayed images, creating an engaging user experience. The convenience of a digital application will allow users to access palm reading services easily.

## Reason
The reasons for this decision are:

1. **Cultural Interest:** Palm reading is a practice followed by many people worldwide for entertainment, curiosity, or guidance. A digital application would make this practice more accessible.

2. **Interactive Experience:** The interactivity of the application will engage users, making their experience more personalized and enjoyable.

3. **Convenience:** An application provides a more convenient and accessible way for users to get palm readings, removing the need to seek out a physical palm reading service.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- We will need to research and understand the various aspects of palm reading to accurately implement them in the application.
- Interactive design will require extra attention to ensure an engaging user experience.
- We might need to handle user skepticism or doubt about the accuracy of digital palm readings.
- With the successful development and launch of this application, we can expect to cater to a niche yet globally spread audience.
