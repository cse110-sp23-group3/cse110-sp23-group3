# ADR: Definition of "Done"

## Context
We are working on a CRUD web application for palm reading and fortune telling. It is essential to have a clear understanding among all team members regarding when our project can be considered "done". 

## Decision
Our project will be considered "done" when the following conditions are met:

1. All team members are satisfied with the state of the product.
2. There exists a functional CRUD web app that performs palm reading.
3. An offline version or backup of the app is ready in case the API is down.
4. Every individual involved in the project, including the end-user, is satisfied with the current state of the project.
5. The project repository/pathways are organized, presentable, and uniform.
6. The app is devoid of any obvious bugs that users could find and can deliver satisfactory palm readings.
7. The project satisfies a defined set of expectations and designs, backed by thorough tests that prove functionality.
8. The project has achieved a pre-determined stopping point, either based on time or a common expectation for a project version.

## Reason
This decision is reached based on team consensus. These points ensure that we have a functional product that meets user expectations, is well-organized, thoroughly tested, and satisfactory to all team members and stakeholders. It also establishes a clear completion point that will allow the team to effectively transition to subsequent tasks, such as preparing presentations or starting new projects.

## Status
Accepted

## Consequences
- Team members will need to work collaboratively to meet these criteria.
- There may be differences in individual satisfaction levels; finding a common ground may require negotiation.
- The team may need to work on bugs, enhancements, or additional features to reach a state of satisfaction.
- The team will need to balance quality, feature completeness, and time constraints to decide on a stopping point for the project.
