## Agenda

* Say ideas/look at ideas on Miro board
* Vote on a final idea
* Assign roles for the project

## Notes

* Must be CRUD (create, read, update, delete) style fortune telling app
* Everything else is up to interpretation
* Ideas:
  * Game: black-ops 2 (from Call of Duty)
    * have mystery box animation
    * you need a certain amount of points to spin the mystery box
    * spins like a slot machine and lands on an option
    * you chose whether to take the option
    * you can capture the screenshot and post it
  * Do a lion king theme
    * we should definitely try to incorperate this into the app
    * either talking snail or Mufasa or make a fortune teller from another character from Lion King
  * Do Tarot cards, etc.
  * Arnold Schwartsnegger based fortune telling app (Mico can do the voice)
  * A simple tarot cards app with some sort of effects/animations (make it more visual)

* Question: does app need to be super CRUD-focused or just have elements of CRUD?
  * just needs to have elements of CRUD, does not need to be strictly CRUD
  * e.g. basic app that just creates, reads, updates, deletes
  * lots of actions of mystery box would affect data/storage
  * fortune telling part we can be creative with

* Flushing out ideas:
  * Lion king idea:
    * we could put that theme on a lot of different ideas
    * maybe should not do freform since it would get complicated to code
    * We want to try to be visual, not just text and bad animations
      * do palm reading fortune teller?
        * don't need to upload picture, but can
        * if we have you upload a picture, need to have technology to read it
        * maybe should start with a basic app where you look at hand and input data, and later add hand upload
        * try to connect your traits from palm reading with traits in the Lion King
      * there are also astrology, tarot card, palm reading
    * Idea: diff characters tell fortune (some lean more negative and some lead more positive)
      * e.g. Severus Snape reading fortune - seems like villan so might have bad intentions when giving fortune
      * but where would we draw the line?
    * Palm Reading:
      * follow rules, you get your fortune
    * Tarot card - play for a better fortune?
  * Do we want to just start with one fortune telling method? (e.g. Palm Reading)
    * let's start with palm reading
      * if we have time, we can use other methods
    * what theme should we do?
      * lion king - consistent with our brand
      * UCSD colleges (as alternate theme)
      * Arnold Schwartsnegger
      * Something more mythlike
    * Different personalities for different fortunes (but start with 1)
* We voted on the above four themes and pretty much everyone voted for **Lion King/Animal Kingdom theme**
  * we also voted for technique and decided on **palm reading**

Pitch:

* Ideas for vision for app:
  * have lion king character walk you through how to look at your own hand and input the data
  * afterwards, the character talks about your fortune and you get a text version of it as well
  * use video on Miro as entrance ceremony thing (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6lP7AKRG74&pp=ygURbXVmYXNhIGluIHRoZSBza3k%3D)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6lP7AKRG74&pp=ygURbXVmYXNhIGluIHRoZSBza3k%3D]

* For final product:
  * formalize what is in these meeting notes
  * make a visual representation of the app

Need to have pitch done by Friday midnight (Malcom said we can do it by midnight)

To do:

* Do research on palm reading apps
* Give a general summary of our idea
  * what we want to do
  * how it might work
  * possible features to add in the future
  * show how it is related to fortune telling
* Make a visual diagram of what the app could look like

How to have all elements of CRUD:

* have user input 3 times
* ask user if want to input another time or not

## Final TODOs:

**researchers** (Nick, Michael, Anh) - due tonight.
* look for research on palm reading and its purpose; look at palm reading apps and their pros/cons; understand user stories as to why they are used.

**pitch summarizers** (Dylan, Jiaen, Chris?) - due friday 3pmish. 
* summarize our app; its purpose, the basic functionalities of it, feel free to add other features we can implement in the future

**diagrammers** (Faith, Chaeyeon, Mico Guinto) - due friday midnight (we need 1/2 to do so)
* create a sketch prototype about what you might see on a basic iteration of the app. convo can happen in #developers

**Henry**
* i think will be overarching leader that will focus on hopping between groups and checking on how their progress is. i will too but will mostly be focusing on #3

**work should be done in miro; keep convos in this channel, #design or make a new channel (MAKE SURE TO COLLABORATE so we donâ€™t have different versions!)**
