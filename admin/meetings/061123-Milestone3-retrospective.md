## Agenda
  
New Business:
* Retrospective on Milestone 3
  * Have each person say one thing you are pround of and one thing you would have done if we had more time

## Notes

Faith:

* Proud of: app looks really nice, and we pulled it off even with all our busy schedules
* if had more time: would jump into more web dev stuff (did not get to it as much this quarter)

Mico:

* if had more time, would have contributed more with web dev stuff
* Liked: communcation we did
  * it was good to be able to look at issues, catch up, and contribute

Henry:

* did good job in terms of app itself (it is better than expected)
* Communication was also great; people were on time and responsive
* If had more time, would probably refactor some of the code or think of a new structure completely
  * designed for freeform originally, so too complex for buttons
* It is cool that we made a chat rather than just a survey

Chris:

* People were responsive and took responsibility for what we should do
* Product we made was pretty good; much more complex than other groups

Michael:

* Happy with how project turned out
* Liked what we were able to do with all the constraints
* It was nice seeing things get fixed
* **From Zoom Chat:** I forgot about that, Iâ€™ll say if we had more time we could add different characters instead of just Simba, and have music to make the experience more immersive

Jiaen:

* We did a good job in such a few weeks
* It was good to work with everyone
* Jiaen did not contribute a lot to the code; would have tried to do more code contributions if had more time
* happy to have worked with everyone in this group for this last quarter

Nick:

* we have grown a lot from the beginning
* would add refinements to dark theme and perhaps settings for more themes

Dylan:

* proud that we improved throughout
* we were also constantly changing yet were still able to adapt
* future: make an easier way to make the chat work

Chay:

* Our project looks fantastic. I feel like we have made significant improvements. I want to express my appreciation to all team members. Thank you.

Anh:

* Something I am proud of:
  * We finish it and had better communication on the Mile Stone 2
  * Documenting and project management. I asked Malcolm and he said we are good at that too.
  * We are flexible on project

* If I have more time:
  * Hang out more with other folks
  * Work more on the test. ( But I mean we changed the way it works so it hard to make the test first)
