## Meeting Notes

Milestone 1 Retrospective:
* what we are glad about
  * we were able to do things despite having busy schedules and tech issues (e.g. could not clone repo)
  * clearly listed issues/problems we wanted to solve
  * we have finished the basic structure of the UI
  * be flexible, even during midterm season
  * stay organized with our issues
  * app is turning out well
  * we pulled it together for this milestone
  * many important functions of app have been made
  * we were able to achieve our milestone (got chatbox made); we are at a good spot
* what we need to work on:
  * communication - sometimes it takes time to get ahold of someone
  * script is currently written in HTML file - should move to separate file
    * should have separate js files for different functionalities
    * this way, people can work on separate files and we can avoid merge conflicts
  * we can make UI more fancy for Milestone 2 and add more Lion King theme
  * let's try a different programming style like pair programming or mobbing
  * communicating/being able to get ahold of people quicker
  * maybe have zoom meetings/check-ins before milestone deadline
    * should say what you have done or if you haven't done anything
    * should make sure everyone knows everyone else is working
    * if people are not working, help us to understand why/what is going on
  * could have a formatted check-in to know where everyone is at
  * people should be more active checking GitHub issues; conversations need to be recorded there
  * we kind of procrastinated too much
  * have a more systematic approach for checking issues to ensure more discussion and implementation
    * perhaps peer programming?
  * biggest issue is communication and ease of communication
    * it can be hard to contact people on things
  * tasks were delegated with intention that people would peer program
  * on next set of issues, when we create issues and decide who will work on what, we can discuss whether to do peer or mob in the issues themselves
    * e.g. try to coordinate time to code at same time
    * maybe try to have set time when people are working during the day (can be remote, but have set working hours)
    * **Action:** Faith will make when2meet for times when we should all be working on project live
  * need to do halfway mini-checkpoint to prevent procrastination, which will define what progress will be expected

Milestone 2:
* will be 1 week long
* will be released Sun afternoon or Mon
* will make midway point check-in on Zoom

This weekend **actions**:
* Milestone 2 will be brainstormed this weekend
  * will focus on scripts, making it pretty, improving CRUD functionality, extra things
* The chatbox functionality will be a separate milestone
* if you have time, try to add issues and start conversations
* by Monday, milestone will be organized
